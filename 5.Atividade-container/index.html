            One Monday afternoon, Mike, adopting a very unusual style, wore a hoody. Nobody would ever think of wearing a hoody on a very hot day. His friends also wondered why he was being weird. They became a little aloof with Mike that day. The next day, Mike wore a hoody again, this time of a different color. This went on every day for a week and his friends gradually got used to it. Finally, on the eighth day, Mike wore a plain white shirt, acting like nothing had been amiss for the past week. One of his friends asked him, “Are you finally done with your hoody fashion?” “What hoody fashion?” Mike asked. “Last week, everyday, you kept on wearing a hoody.” And then Mike said, “What? I was on vacation last week. I just got home this morning. ”
